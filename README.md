# Project-Recon

## Decription
>This project is created using Bash, it's just a mere set of commands combined with publicly available tools like (subfinder,shodan,gospider etc.) for simple Recon Automation for performing  web application penetration testing, Depending upon the attack surface of the script there are three options, if the bugbounty or VDP program as small scope we can use -s and if the program has medium or large scope we can use -m and -a switch respectively, accordingly the process of subdomain enumeration, resolving, finding important keywords/parameters and eventually checking for Xss vulnerability is carried out.
