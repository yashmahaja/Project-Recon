## Decription
>This is a Personal project created using Bash, it's just a mere set of commands used to combine with publicly available tools like (subfinder,shodan,gospider etc.) for simple Recon Automation for performing  web application penetration testing, Depending upon the attack surface, the script there are three options, if the bugbounty or VDP program as small scope we can use -s switch or  if the program has medium or large scope ie large attack surface we can use -m and -a switch respectively, accordingly the process of subdomain enumeration, resolving, finding important keywords/parameters and eventually checking for Xss vulnerability is carried out.
